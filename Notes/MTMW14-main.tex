	\section{Module guide}
	\subsection{MTMW14 objectives}
	MTMW14 aims to take you from the basic principles of numerical modelling, mostly learned in MTMW12, to the foundations of current weather and climate models, bringing you up to speed with the vital components of state-of-the-art numerical models for atmospheres and oceans and their use in predicting weather and climate.
	
	Starting from fundamental properties of atmosphere and ocean:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Learn how to design numerical schemes, preserving key properties.
\item	Perform simple prediction using models you will build.
\item	Critically evaluate and interrogate models.
\item	Prepare you for designing, implementing and testing your own components, to be inserted and used in complex models.
\end{itemize}
	
	This competence is going to be very useful in your careers, even if you aim to analyse, albeit not develop models. All is accomplished by doing, rather than just watching a lecturer.  This module is therefore mostly hands-on: you will learn by doing, and 70\% of the total marks are awarded for your work in the two projects.

When setting out to solve the problems proposed in either project, it is important to distinguish what is expected from the analytical solutions (when available) and what is produced by the numerical solutions.

	\section{Motivation}\index{Motivation}
	
	Dale Durran's introductory words provide both a concise history of numerical simulation, and motivation for learning as much as possible about state-of-the-art numerical methods.
	
	\begin{quotation}
	The possibility of deterministic weather prediction was suggested by Vilhelm Bjerknes as early as 1904. Around the time of the First World War, Lewis Richardson actually attempted to produce such a forecast by manually integrating a finite-difference approximation to the equations governing atmospheric motion. Unfortunately, his calculations did not yield a reasonable forecast. Moreover, the human labor required to obtain this disappointing result was so great that subsequent attempts at deterministic weather prediction had to await the introduction of a high-speed computational aid. In 1950, a team of researchers, under the direction of Jule Charney and John von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study, at Princeton, journeyed to the Aberdeen Proving Ground, where they worked for approximately 24 h to coax a one-day weather forecast from the first general-purpose electronic computer, the ENIAC.\footnote{ENIAC is an acronym for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator.} The first computer-generated weather forecast was surprisingly good, and its success led to the rapid growth of a new meteorological subdiscipline, “numerical weather prediction.” These early efforts in numerical weather prediction also began a long and fruitful collaboration between numerical analysts and atmospheric scientists.\footnote{Further details about these early weather prediction efforts may be found in Bjerknes (1904), Richardson (1922), Charney et al. (1950), Burks and Burks (1981), and Thompson (1983).} The use of numerical models in atmospheric and oceanic science has subsequently expanded into almost all areas of active research. Numerical models are currently employed to study phenomena as diverse as global climate change, the interaction of ocean currents with bottom topography, the evolution of atmospheric pollutants within an urban airshed, and the development of rotation in tornadic thunderstorms.

	\section{Historical aspects of Numerical Modelling}
	
	Expanding upon Dale Durran's introduction, this \href{https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/amsm/59/1/amsmonographs-d-18-0018.1.xml}{Historic review by David Randall} provides a great and synthetic history of numerical modelling for the atmosphere and ocean, which has evolved from very simple box models all the way to complex, multi-scale, multi-component "Earth System Models". \\
