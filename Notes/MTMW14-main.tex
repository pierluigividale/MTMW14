	\section{Module guide}
	\subsection{MTMW14 objectives}
	MTMW14 aims to take you from the basic principles of numerical modelling, mostly learned in MTMW12, to the foundations of current weather and climate models, bringing you up to speed with the vital components of state-of-the-art numerical models for atmospheres and oceans and their use in predicting weather and climate.
	
	Starting from fundamental properties of atmosphere and ocean:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Learn how to design numerical schemes, preserving key properties.
\item	Perform simple prediction using models you will build.
\item	Critically evaluate and interrogate models.
\item	Prepare you for designing, implementing and testing your own components, to be inserted and used in complex models.
\end{itemize}
	
	This competence is going to be very useful in your careers, even if you aim to analyse, albeit not develop models. All is accomplished by doing, rather than just watching a lecturer.\\
	
	
	This module is therefore mostly hands-on: you will learn by doing, and 70\% of the total marks are awarded for your work in the two projects.  \\
	
	Project 1 is about oscillatory / periodic behaviour, and is designed to explore ideas of model initialisation, chaos, ensemble forecasting. \\
	
	Project 2 is about 2D wave motion, and introduces spatial schemes and solution methods that are commonly found in today's state-of-the-art models. \\
	
	In both cases, it is important to distinguish what is expected from the analytical solutions (when available) and what is produced by the numerical solutions.

	\subsection{Going for numbers}
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	There are no analytical solutions to the Primitive Equations: we mostly rely on numerical solutions, which are achieved by a number of methods. The most common method is the finite difference method, but we shall briefly look into the spectral and finite elements methods.
	
	The following is a mindmap of this ten week module.
	
	
	\section{Historical aspects of Numerical Modelling}
	
	This \href{https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/amsm/59/1/amsmonographs-d-18-0018.1.xml}{Historic review by David Randall} provides a great and synthetic history of numerical modelling for the atmosphere and ocean, which has evolved from very simple box models all the way to complex, multi-scale, multi-component "Earth System Models". \\

\subsection{Real world applications: hurricane and Typhoon simulation in climate GCMs}

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/TC-structures}
\end{center}

\subsection{Why the differences}
These GCMs are very different in terms of dynamical core, parameterizations etc., but they are also quite different in terms of the use of the time step. I have been experimenting with our UK model (HadGEM3), and Colin Zarzycki has been experimenting with the NCAR model, managing to double the number of hurricanes with a time step of 1/4, but I have also tested the same ideas in the ECMWF model, since it is the one that uses very long time steps.
